# 3 Month Coding Challenge

**3-Month Coding Challenge: Data Structures, Algorithms, and Web Development**

This coding challenge is designed to enhance your skills in data structures, algorithms, and web development over a span of three months. Each month will focus on specific topics, gradually increasing in complexity and combining theory with practical applications. The challenge assumes that you have a basic understanding of programming fundamentals and web development concepts.

[**Month 1: Data Structures and Algorithms**](./1month.md)

In the first month of this coding challenge, the primary focus will be on understanding and mastering data structures and their fundamental uses. Data structures are fundamental building blocks in computer science, and they play a crucial role in organizing and storing data efficiently. By the end of this month, you should have a solid grasp of various data structures and how to use them effectively.

In the second month of this coding challenge, we will take a deeper dive into advanced data structures and focus on algorithm design using these structures. Building upon the foundational knowledge from the previous month, we will explore more sophisticated data structures and learn how to leverage them to develop efficient algorithms for various computational problems.

[**Month 3: Web Development**](./3month.md)

In the final month of this coding challenge, we will shift our focus towards practicality and real-world application by delving into the exciting world of web development. This month aims to make you proficient in various web development areas, enabling you to build interactive and dynamic web applications.

**Final Task:**
Combine your data structures, algorithms, and web development skills to create a web-based application that solves a real-world problem. The application should handle data efficiently using the data structures and algorithms you learned throughout the challenge.

Remember to practice consistently, tackle coding problems regularly, and work on mini-projects to reinforce your learning. Happy coding!
