## What is these club really about?

I have been a student at Anjuman College of Engineering for almost 3 years now. I came here from Government Polytechnic Nagpur directly into the 2nd year of engineering. Since then, I've seen the potential in the students of my college. Anjuman never have a low talent pool; there have always been students with great potential. Unfortunately, they never reach their full potential during their college days (neither did I).

### Our club was an idea to build a developers community for the students of ACET.


## What is Github?

You can do the google search. You can go through the internet if you want to. But all Github is like the cool hangout spot for your code on the internet. It's where you can upload and store all your code files in a super organized way. Once your code is up there, it's open for anyone to check out and use. It's like sharing your favorite recipe with friendsâ€”everyone gets to enjoy it! Thats all you need to know about github (atleast for now).

### You can always check out the videos created by GitHub itself.

## Why break your head creating a github account?

The central entity of our club is this website or platform that you are currently reading our blog on. All the code files of this platform are fully accessible on GitHub, allowing anyone to access and make changes to them. The club emphasizes having active members who are willing to contribute to the platform by making changes. To modify this platform, all you need is a GitHub account.

### Here are a few additional points to consider: (Ignore it for now)

1. Active participation in the club involves not only accessing the code but also actively engaging in discussions, proposing improvements, and collaborating with other members.
2. Members are encouraged to adhere to coding standards and guidelines to maintain the quality and consistency of the platform.
3. Regular contributions can include fixing bugs, adding new features, improving user experience, and optimizing performance.
4. The club fosters a collaborative environment where members can learn from each other, share knowledge, and grow their skills.
5. Continuous feedback and iteration are essential aspects of the club's culture, allowing the platform to evolve and adapt to changing needs and requirements.
6. Members are also encouraged to document their changes, submit pull requests, and participate in code reviews to ensure transparency and accountability in the development process.
