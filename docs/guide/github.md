## What is these club really about?

I have been a Student of Anjuman College of Engineering for almost 3 years now. I came here from Government Polytechnic Nagpur in 2nd year. Since then I see the potential in the students of my College.
Anjuman never have a low talent poll, there has always been students with great potential. Unforuntaley they never reach there full potential during there college days (neither did I).

### Our club was an idea to build a developers community for the students.


## What is Github?

You can do the google search. You can go through the internet about what is Github. But all Github does is a puts your code files on internet that is managemented and maintained in an organised way.
